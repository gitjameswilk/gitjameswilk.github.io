            <p>I'm more than just a front-end developer. I understand how the back-end works and what pitfalls and wins the front-end can get, I know when a piece of logic will over complicate a user experince, and I know when a design needs tweaked to work in the browser. I also organize Full Stack Toronto a large conference and meetup series for web developers and designers. I've also won two international awards for Digital Out of Home Projects. I'm ready to collaborate with you on your next project!</p>
