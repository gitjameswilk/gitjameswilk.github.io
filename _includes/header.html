            <p>I'm more than just a front-end developer. I understand how the back-end works and what pitfalls and wins the front-end can get, I know when a piece of logic will over complicate a user experince, and I know when a design needs tweaked to work in the browser. I also organize Full Stack Toronto a large conference and meetup for web developers.</p>
